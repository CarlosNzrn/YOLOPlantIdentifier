# YOLO to Identify Plants

Cerrado biodiversity is home to 7,000 plant species, being considered the most diverse tropical savanna in the world. Despite this, it is still despised and threatened. Producing accurate knowledge about plant identification is necessary for its preservation. This is the role of taxonomists, however taxonomy is still traditional, identifying and characterizing species based on pure and simple comparison.

Using Darknet, an algorithm developed by Joseph Redmon, this project aims to build an identifier for plant species. In "Image Processing" are the resources used in image processing that built the dataset used in the training of the neural network. In "Plant Identifier" is the notebook used in Colab, the weights and the results of the identification of 15 samples.
